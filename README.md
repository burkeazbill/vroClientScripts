Hello Orchestrator enthusiasts! 
I have completed a small set of articles that provide example scripts in 
perl, python, and powershell that can start a vRO / vCO workflow via it's REST API. 

I've created custom bit.ly URLs for each of them as well as my old REST article for easy reference. 
The three scripts all maintain a similar format, but I invite you experts 
(and those who are simply just more experienced than me) to provide 
feedback/comments to improve the reusability of these scripts.

Scripting examples:

http://bit.ly/perlvco 
http://bit.ly/pythonvco 
http://bit.ly/powershellvco 
http://bit.ly/restvco
